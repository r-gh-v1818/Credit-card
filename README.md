# Credit-card
Credit Card Approval Predictor
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques. The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building to predict whether an individual's credit card application will be approved.

Project Overview
Commercial banks receive numerous applications for credit cards, many of which get rejected for reasons such as high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is time-consuming and error-prone. By leveraging machine learning, this task can be automated efficiently.

Steps in the Notebook:
Loading and Viewing the Dataset: Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure.
Handling Missing Values: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to build intuitions and understand the data better.
Building the Model: Develop a machine learning model to predict credit card approvals.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Note that the dataset has been anonymized due to confidentiality concerns.
